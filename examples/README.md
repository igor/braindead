# Examples (Unpublished)

**Status:** Work in progress - not linked from main documentation

This folder contains real implementation examples that may be:
- Too specific to be immediately useful
- Containing patterns that need abstraction
- Works in progress awaiting documentation

These serve as reference material for creating abstracted patterns in the main docs.

## Current Examples

- **project-workspace-skill/** - Custom skill for automating project-specific CLAUDE.md setup

As patterns mature and get abstracted, they move to `/docs/` and get properly documented.
