# Examples

This folder contains sanitized real-world examples showing how the patterns work in practice.

## About These Examples

**Important**: These examples show *patterns*, not prescriptions.

The professional context (consulting, research, strategic work) is just one possible application. The underlying patterns apply to any knowledge work:

- **Project structure** → Any complex multi-phase work
- **Area organization** → Any ongoing responsibility
- **RAG collections** → Any reference material you query frequently
- **Workflow automation** → Any repeated process

### How to Use These Examples

1. **Recognize the pattern** - What problem is being solved?
2. **Adapt to your domain** - What's your equivalent?
3. **Start simple** - You don't need everything shown here

### Common Adaptations

| Example Shows | Your Equivalent Might Be |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Client projects | Product features, research studies, writing projects |
| Research synthesis | Literature review, market analysis, competitive research |
| Board presentations | Tech specs, design docs, grant proposals |
| Strategic frameworks | Architecture patterns, design systems, methodology docs |
| Stakeholder management | Team coordination, cross-functional collaboration |

The infrastructure patterns (PARA, frontmatter, CLAUDE.md, RAG) remain the same regardless of domain.

- Project folder organization
- README.md with project overview
- INSTRUCTIONS.md with operating context
- Research Insights Index
- Proper frontmatter usage

**Based on:** Real client brand strategy project
**Sanitized:** Client names replaced with "Client A", specific details genericized

### [area-example/](area-example/)

Sanitized area structure showing:
- Area organization
- AREA_CONTEXT.md usage
- Flexible folder structure

**Based on:** Real internal area (Studio OS)
**Sanitized:** Personal details removed, kept structure

### [claude-config-example/](claude-config-example/)

Example Claude Code configuration showing:
- Filled-out CLAUDE.md (not just template)
- Agent docs with real workflows
- Collection registry with multiple collections

**Based on:** Actual working configuration
**Sanitized:** Infrastructure details genericized, paths replaced with placeholders

### [rag-query-examples/](rag-query-examples/)

Sample RAG queries and results showing:
- Different query types (exploratory vs focused)
- Result formatting
- Multi-query strategies

**Based on:** Real queries from working system
**Sanitized:** Content genericized, sources anonymized

## Using These Examples

1. **Browse to understand patterns** - See how templates get filled in actual use
2. **Compare with templates** - Templates show structure, examples show reality
3. **Adapt to your domain** - Don't copy exactly, learn the patterns
4. **See the difference** - Between "perfect" templates and "good enough" reality

---

## Notes

- These are **simplified versions** of real structures
- Real projects are messier and that's okay
- Structure evolves with use
- Perfect is the enemy of good
