# Examples (Experimental)

**Status:** Experimental patterns - not part of main documentation yet

This folder contains real implementation examples that are:

- Works in progress
- Too specific to be immediately useful without adaptation
- Awaiting abstraction into general patterns

These serve as reference material for developing the patterns documented in `/docs/`.

## Current Examples

- **project-workspace-skill/** - Custom skill for automating project-specific CLAUDE.md setup

As patterns mature and get abstracted, they move to `/docs/` and get properly documented.
