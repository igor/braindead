### Critical Dependencies from Client

- Access to existing research and previous materials
- Feedback on initial concepts by Oct 16
- Technical constraints for ecosystem integration

## Strategic Imperatives

Five core priorities from kickoff workshop:

1. **Lead generation over direct monetization** - Primary KPI should be qualified leads generated

2. **Integration as critical consideration** - Must evaluate whether ecosystem integration adds genuine user value

3. **Companionship as core philosophy** - "Daily Companionship" with natural interaction

4. **Sustainability as strategic narrative** - Climate, Community, Circularity themes

5. **Partnership strategy for market entry** - Explore "powered by" collaborations

### Non-Negotiables

- Must explore integration options thoroughly
- Must incorporate companionship philosophy
- Must address sustainability narrative
- Must consider partnership approaches

## Working Conventions

### Deliverables Format

- Summary documents: 3-5 pages
- Analysis reports: 7-15 pages
- Research reports: 25-30 pages
- Visual deliverables in Figma
- Weekly check-in reviews on Thursdays at 2pm

### Communication Protocols

- Weekly Thursday check-ins (30-45 min structured reviews)
- Slack for quick questions/updates
- Email for formal deliverable sharing
- Major deliverables shared 1-2 days before check-in
- Feedback turnaround: 3-5 business days

### Success Metrics Focus

- Behavioral evidence over surveys
- Purchase intent through natural tasks, not direct questions
- Feature-value correlation based on observed behavior
- Clear value hierarchy: what users will actually pay for

## Risk Register

Current active risks:

- Board timing pressure (mitigation: early November synthesis)
- Integration complexity (technical constraints needed from client)
